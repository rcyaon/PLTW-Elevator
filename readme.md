<h4>Problem 5: Elevator <br><i>Hardware Level 4 Software Level 4</i><br></h4>
A company would like to begin producing residential elevators. Your team must design the control system and a prototype of an elevator that can go between three floors in any combination. The prototype must include a set of three switches to represent each floor of the elevator. Each floor the elevator stops at must have a call button and a set of three lights to indicate where the elevator is currently located. A built-in safety mechanism requires that the elevator normally rest on the ground floor and return to the ground floor after a user-determined period of nonuse.<br>
